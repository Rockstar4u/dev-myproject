3.2 IAM Roles
Purpose: Provide permissions for AWS resources, enforcing the principle of least privilege.
Connections:
•	Attach IAM roles to EC2 instances, RDS, and other managed AWS services.
•	Connect IAM roles to S3 for access control.
Annotation: “IAM Role: Assigns permissions to AWS resources ensuring least privilege access.”
3.3 AWS KMS
Purpose: Manage encryption keys for data protection.
Connections:
•	Link AWS KMS to RDS for database encryption.
•	Connect KMS to S3 for encrypting objects stored in buckets.
Annotation: “AWS KMS: Provides encryption key management ensuring data at rest is secure.”
3.4 CloudWatch
Purpose: Monitoring and observability for AWS services.
Connections:
•	Link CloudWatch to all instances and managed services for logging and monitoring.
Annotation: “AWS CloudWatch: Centralizes logging and monitoring for real-time insights and alerting.”

3.5 CloudTrail
Purpose: Log and monitor AWS API calls for auditing and security analysis.
Connections:
•	Integrate CloudTrail with AWS account to track all API activity.
Annotation: “AWS CloudTrail: Tracks API calls to detect and respond to changes in the environment.”
3.6 S3
Purpose: Storage service for backups, logs, and static content.
Connections:
•	Connect S3 to CloudTrail for log storage.
•	Use S3 for backups from RDS and other critical data storage needs.
Annotation: “Amazon S3: Provides scalable storage for backups, logs, and static content.”



4. Control Matrices
Mapping Security Controls to Compliance Requirements:
Compliance Requirement (GDPR)	Security Control Implementation
Data Protection	AES-256 encryption for data at rest, TLS 1.2+ for data in transit
Access Control	IAM roles and policies, MFA for all access
Data Integrity	Digital signatures and hashing
Availability	Auto-scaling and load balancing, regular backups and disaster recovery
Incident Response	IDS/IPS and incident response plan
Monitoring	Centralized logging and continuous monitoring



6. Security Measures
5.1 Policies and Procedures
Data Encryption Policies:
•	Enforce encryption for all sensitive data using AES-256.
•	Implement TLS 1.2 or higher for secure data transmission.
Access Control Policies:
•	Use RBAC to ensure users have the minimum necessary access.
•	Implement MFA for an additional layer of security.
Operational Procedures:
•	Regularly update and patch all systems and applications to protect against vulnerabilities.
•	Conduct security training and awareness programs for employees to foster a security-conscious culture.
5.2 Encryption
•	At Rest: Utilize AWS KMS for managing encryption keys and ensuring AES-256 encryption.
•	In Transit: Use TLS/SSL certificates for all communication channels to protect data in transit.
5.3 Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS)
•	Deploy AWS GuardDuty: For continuous threat detection and monitoring.
•	Implement AWS WAF: To protect against web application attacks by filtering malicious traffic.
5.4 Logging and Monitoring

6. Implementation
Terraform Code:
To comply with ECC, CCC, and GDPR regulations, we need to create separate Infrastructure as Code (IaC) resources for Europe and China using Terraform. For this purpose, two .tfvars files are created. Use the following commands to create the resources:



Key Points of the Architecture:
•	Two separate VPCs: One for Europe and one for China.
•	Security groups: Tailored for each region.
•	Instances: Deployed in each region with IAM roles and policies.
•	Logging, monitoring, and encryption: Implemented for compliance.
